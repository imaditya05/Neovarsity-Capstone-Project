## 📊 What Was Skipped (Not Critical for Booking)

Since the main focus is **ticket booking**, we skipped:
- ❌ Detailed theater details page
- ❌ Screen management UI
- ❌ Edit theater form

These can be added later if needed, but aren't required for core booking functionality.

## 🔗 Movie-Theater Integration

When theater owners add movies, they can now:
1. **See their theaters** in a dropdown
2. **Associate movie with theater** (optional)
3. **Get helpful message** if they don't have theaters yet

This links movies to specific theaters, which is essential for:
- Showing which theaters are playing which movies
- Creating showtimes (next step!)
- Booking tickets for specific theater-movie combinations
